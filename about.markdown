This blog was motivated by the general lack of information available online about financial securities (e.g. bond, equities) operational processes (e.g. settlements, asset servicing). While I do not consider myself to be an expert in all aspects of securities operations, it is also my belief that some information is better than none.

Whether you work in a proprietary trading bank, investment manager, custodian bank, or depository, I hope the information on the blog helps you in one way or another. Please do contact me at <ronnie.ong.zg@gmail.com> if you spot any inaccuracies within any post or would like to discuss further in general.

Ronnie Ong ([LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ronnie-ong/)) has 7 years of experience in improving securities operational processes in a bank. His expertise lies primarily in bonds.
